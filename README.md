## Project Overview

The Operationalize ML project contains a Machine Learning Microservice, built on **Scikit-Learn**. It contains a model that predicts house prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). 

### What does this project do?

- Run a docker container
- Upload container into a public registry (hub.docker.com)
- Run the deployed application in a Kubernetes cluster
- Integrate with CircleCI for continuous integration

### START HERE

#### Step 0
- Fork this repo and clone it to your local workstation (obviously)
#### Step 1: Install dependencies
- Set up the environment by running `make setup`. This will create a virtual environment in your home directory called `.devops`
- Install dependencies by running `make install`
- (Optionally) Lint application (requires hadolint)

#### Step 2: Run Docker container
- Run the application on docker by calling `./run_docker.sh`

### Step 3: Upload to Docker Hub
- In the `./upload_docker.sh` file, edit the dockerpath (line 8) and change the docker username to a personalized one (or leave it as is, to use the public kcemenike/microproject:v1.0.0)
- To upload to docker hub, run `./upload_docker.sh`

### Step 4: Kubernetes deployment
- To deploy to kubernetes, run `./run_kubernetes.sh`


Your project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:
* Test your project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

You can find a detailed [project rubric, here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2576/view).

**The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operationalize production microservices.**

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl
